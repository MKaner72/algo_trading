# My first algorithmic trading project in Python

Here I will be publishing the code that I have created for my first algorithmic trading program in python. Since I am quite new to this topic, some of the strategies will be rudimentary, but I hope that it is insightful to some.

Starting out, I decided to focus on equities that had the highest trading volume relative to others. The reasoning behind this is that I would like to capitalize on the liquidity of the stock and exploit the market microstructure that is present. Equities that have the highest trading volume are: NVDA, TSLA, MSFT, AAPL and AMD.
